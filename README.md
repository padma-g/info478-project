### Purpose

The purpose of this research project is to visualize healthcare utilization by country over time. We hope to understand the differences in healthcare utilization across countries and the factors that affect healthcare utilization. This research project will allow us to identify which countries have lower healthcare utilization and could benefit from additional healthcare utilization. It will also allow stakeholders to visualize the healthcare utilization over time.

**Related Work #1: Trends in Hospital Inpatient Stays in the United States, 2005-2014**

Summary:
This statistical brief shows the change over time in hospital stays between 2005 and 2014 in the United States. One key finding is that the number of hospital stays for mental health and substance use increased by 20% from 2005 to 2014. The number of hospital stays related to surgery decreased. Finally, it was found that a lower income is correlated with a higher hospitalization rate.

**Related Work #2: Healthcare Cost and Utilization Report**

Summary:
This report analyzes spending, price, and utilization trends between 2012 and 2016 for Americans with commercial health insurance. One key finding is that there was a 4.6% growth in spending per person in 2016. Another key finding is that healthcare utilization has decreased since 2012 but prices have increased. Finally, the biggest contributor to the spending increase is surgery costs.

**Related Work #3: How do healthcare prices and use in the U.S. compare to other countries?**

Summary:
This analysis shows differences in healthcare costs and utilization between countries in recent years. One major finding is that on average, other countries that are wealthy, spend only about half as much on healthcare as people in the United States do. Additionally, people in the United States have hospital stays that are much shorter than those in other countries. The average length of an inpatient hospital stay in the United States in 2014 was 6.1 days, whereas the average across all countries was 10.2 days. Finally, the average price of many medical procedures is significantly higher in the United States than in other countries.

### Datasets
Below are two potential data sources to use for this project.

The dataset we hope to use comes from the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation (OECD). The dataset contains healthcare utilization data from many different countries over the time period of 2000 to 2018. It includes many indicators of healthcare utilization, such as consultations, surgical procedures, waiting times, average length of stay, and more. The data collected by OECD from a variety of credible health departments across the world. The data was accessed from the OECD website, at the following link: https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=HEALTH_PROC#. 

An alternative dataset comes from the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The dataset contains hospital utilization data related to COVID-19 in the United States over the time period of November 2020 to December 2020. It includes the estimated number of hospital beds occupied for inpatient use for a given state and date. The data was collected by the Department of Health and Human Services as well as by state health departments. The data was accessed from the HHS website, at the following link: https://healthdata.gov/dataset/COVID-19-Estimated-Patient-Impact-and-Hospital-Cap/vzfs-79pr. 

### Target Audience

The target audience can be general as the public audience, but it will be healthcare researchers specifically. Healthcare researchers can use this data visualization to understand the disparities in healthcare utilization across countries and provide assistance to countries with low utilization.

### Potential Benefits and Insights

The healthcare researchers will be able to learn about how different countries perform on their healthcare utilization including consultation, immunization, screening, and more.

Some specific questions that could be answered using this data are:

* Which countries historically have used healthcare more than others?

* Which years had the highest healthcare utilization?

* Which countries could benefit from additional healthcare utilization?

Based on the results, they will also be able to study the factors that affect the quality of healthcare utilization to improve their services.

## Technical Description
### Deliverable Format

We will present our final project in the form of a Shiny app and the final report will be in the form of a HTML page.

### Data Collection and Data Management Challenges

The latest data of health care resources is difficult to find for they might not be open to the public study yet.

### Technical Skills to Learn

We will need to learn technical skills such as using github and gh-pages which can allow us to complete the necessary assignments. We will also need to have technical skills related to Shiny in order to create the app. Furthermore, we need to have technical abilities with managing files and data sets in order to maintain a sense of organization when managing data files.

### Anticipated Challenges

A major challenge we anticipate is remembering the various technical skills from INFO 201. For example, Shiny apps and R markdown. In addition another challenge that we anticipate involves the time availability of group members. It is important that all members have a similar time to meet in order to complete the project deliverables.
