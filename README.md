INFO 478 Group Project

## Project Descrption
Who is your target audience? 

Depending on the domain of your data, there may be a variety of audiences interested in using the dataset. You should hone in on one of these audiences.
The target audience can be general as the public audience, but it will be healthcare researchers specifically. Healthcare researchers can use this data visualization to  understand the disparities in healthcare utilization across countries and provide assistance to countries with low utilization.

What should your audience learn from your resource? Please consider specific questions that your project can answer using the data you have identified (that are related to the overarching purpose)

The healthcare researchers will be able to learn about how different countries perform on their healthcare utilization including consultation, immunization, screening, and more.
Some specific questions that could be answered using this data are:

  Which countries historically have used healthcare more than others?
  Which years had the highest healthcare utilization?
  Which countries could benefit from additional healthcare utilization?
  
Based on the results, they will also be able to study the factors that affect the quality of healthcare utilization to improve their services.


## Technical Description
What will be the format of your final product (Shiny app, HTML page, compiled .Rmd file, etc)?

We will present our final project in the form of a Shiny app and the final report will be in the form of a HTML page.

Do you anticipate any specific data collection / data management challenges?

The latest data of health care resources is difficult to find for they might not be open to the public study yet.

What new technical skills will need to learn in order to complete your project?

We will need to learn technical skills such as using github and gh-pages which can allow us to complete the necessary assignments. We will also need to have technical skills related to Shiny in order to create the app. Furthermore, we need to have technical abilities with managing files and data sets in order to maintain a sense of organization when managing data files.

What major challenges do you anticipate? 

A major challenge I anticipate is remembering the various technical skills from Info 201. For example, Shiny apps and R markdown. In addition another challenge that I anticipate involves the time availability of group members. It is important that all members have a similar time to meet in order to complete the project deliverables.
