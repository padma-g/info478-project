INFO 478 Group Project
## Technical Description
What will be the format of your final product (Shiny app, HTML page, compiled .Rmd file, etc)?

We will present our final project in the form of a Shiny app and the final report will be in the form of a HTML page.

Do you anticipate any specific data collection / data management challenges?

The latest data of health care resources is difficult to find for they might not be open to the public study yet.

What new technical skills will need to learn in order to complete your project?

We will need to learn technical skills such as using github and gh-pages which can allow us to complete the necessary assignments. We will also need to have technical skills related to Shiny in order to create the app. Furthermore, we need to have technical abilities with managing files and data sets in order to maintain a sense of organization when managing data files.

What major challenges do you anticipate? 

A major challenge I anticipate is remembering the various technical skills from Info 201. For example, Shiny apps and R markdown. In addition another challenge that I anticipate involves the time availability of group members. It is important that all members have a similar time to meet in order to complete the project deliverables.
